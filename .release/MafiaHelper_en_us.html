<h3 id="general-information">General information</h3>
<p><em><strong>MafiaHelper</strong></em> is the moderator’s assistant for the game “Mafia”. It allows you to track
the current statuses of players, their roles, and also process their use according to the rules
of the game.</p>
<p><em><strong>Since there are many variants of “Mafia”, this guide will outline the rules that are included
in the current version of the application. They may not comply with official competition requirements
and may be changed or supplemented in new versions of the product.</strong></em></p>

<p> </p>
<h3 id="implemented-game-rules">Implemented game rules</h3>
<p>The game can be played by 5 to 30 people inclusive. There is also a person moderating the game and using
this application.</p>

<p>When you start the app, similar to the game itself, you’re prompted to specify the names of players
and their roles. In reality, this is done using simple playing cards or special thematic cards. They’re
distributed to players “in private”. Everyone (except the moderator) gets one role, which initially
only he / she knows.</p>
<p>Next, <em><strong>zero night</strong></em> is announced, and all players close their eyes (usually with their hands or masks,
options are possible). The moderator takes turns interviewing the roles present in the game (except for
<code>townspeople</code>) in order to “get to know” the players who got them. The information received is entered
into the application.</p>

<p>Then a <em><strong>zero day</strong></em> is announced (the app is not used), during which players implement representative
functions related to the game process. The players see each other. This requires each of them to carefully
simulate the absence of any special role.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The essence of the gameplay is the confrontation between civilians and the mafia. Each team strives
to destroy the enemy. The psychological emphasis is on the confrontation between the organized minority
(there are initially fewer mafia in the game, but players with this role recognize each other when they
first meet and act together) and the unorganized majority (there are more civilians, but they don’t know
about the roles of other players). Further actions are based on this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em><strong>first night</strong></em> is announced (players close their eyes). The presenter takes turns interviewing
the roles (except for <code>townspeople</code>). The respective players open their eyes and point to some other
player (in some cases you can point to them or skip a turn) to whom they want to apply the action
of their role. The moderator makes appropriate notes in the app. Having completed the role, the player
closes his eyes.</p>

<p>After interviewing all the roles, the moderator announces the <em><strong>first day</strong></em>. When this action is performed,
the app processes the specified notes and displays the changed statuses of players.</p>

<p>The moderator announces the changes that have occurred. Players use this information to discuss and make
assumptions about who the mafia is and how other roles are distributed. Naturally, players can pretend
and mislead each other in order to last longer in the game.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a vote is held, based on the results of which one of the players is “executed”
(he leaves the game). A corresponding note is made in the app. As a rule, a certain time is allocated
for voting and discussion. If after its expiration the decision is not made, the “execution” is cancelled.</p>
<p>This is followed again by a night, during which actions similar to those described for the first night
are performed, but with a changed composition of players. The cycle of day and night phases continues
until a winning situation is achieved. For the <em><strong>mafia</strong></em>, a victory is considered to be the state
when there are more players with this role than all the others combined (loss becomes mathematically
impossible). Victory for <em><strong>civilians</strong></em> will only be the complete destruction of the mafia.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 id="implemented-roles">Implemented roles</h3>
<p>In the current version, each role in the game is associated with one available action. Additionally,
some roles have certain “abilities”.</p>
<p><em><strong>Townspeople</strong></em> – an ordinary resident of the city, the main composition of the game. He always sleeps
at night, therefore doesn’t know the roles of other players.
During the day, by voting together with the rest of the “living” players, he can choose
one player and “execute” him (such a player leaves the game). He has no other possibilities.
<em>Available on all days</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Mafia</strong></em> is an organized group of players opposing civilians (and <code>yakuza</code>). During the day, he can participate
in voting and discussion, imitating civilians or other roles. At night, he can choose one player
to “kill”. <em>Available on all nights</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Yakuza</strong></em> is the same role as <code>mafia</code> but works as another one team of players (opposing both civilians and <code>mafia</code>).</p>
<p><em><strong>Doctor</strong></em> – a civilian. Action at night – saving the specified player from “murder” (prevents <code>mafia</code>, <code>yakuza</code>,
<code>sheriff</code> and <code>ripper</code> action).
<em>Available on all nights</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Detective</strong></em> – a civilian. Action at night – finding out the role of the specified player (the moderator
tells him with signs whether the specified player belongs to the mafia or not). He can use the collected
information in the day’s discussion. Roles of the <code>mafia boss</code> and the <code>yakuza boss</code> cannot be revealed (the moderator will
give a “civilian” sign). <code>Detective</code> may become a <code>sheriff</code> if the <code>sheriff</code> dies first. <em>Available on all nights</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Prostitute / beauty</strong></em> – a conditionally civilian. Action at night – saving the specified player
(prevents <code>mafia</code>, <code>sheriff</code> and <code>ripper</code> action). But, unlike the <code>doctor</code>, if a player
with this role dies (killed by <code>mafia</code> or <code>ripper</code>), he “takes with him” the player he saved.</p>
<p><em><strong>Maniac</strong></em> – a conditionally civilian. Action at night – remove a living player from the vote. The victim
cannot vote for the next day.</p>
<p><em><strong>Priest / immortal</strong></em> – a civilian. Has no effect. Can be killed only in three cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>when his role is stolen by a <code>thief</code>;</li>
<li>when he ended up with a <code>beauty</code> whom the <code>mafia</code> or <code>ripper</code> came to;</li>
<li>when a <code>kamikaze</code> points at him.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Thief</strong></em> – a conditionally civilian. The action at night is to “disable the role” of the specified player.
The victim doesn’t know that her role has been “stolen” and acts as usual. But her actions will not have
an effect during the current night (the <code>doctor</code> and the <code>beauty</code> will not be able to save, the <code>detective</code>
will receive the wrong answer from the moderator, the <code>priest</code> will lose protection, the <code>maniac</code> will not
change the victim’s condition).
<em>In relation to the <code>mafia</code>, the use of the role is controversial, because it is represented by several players</em>.
<em>In order for the role to work, it is the first called role in the app</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kamikaze</strong></em> – a conditionally civilian. The action during the day is to destroy one player along with
himself (both players leave the game). Usually has a spontaneous character, that is, it’s a source of randomness
in the game.</p>
<p><em><strong>Don / mafia boss</strong></em> – part of <code>mafia</code>. He doesn’t have a separate action; he plays the role of the <code>mafia</code>
in composition. Boss is protected from disclosure of the role by the <code>detective</code>. He is counted as a <code>mafia</code> when
determining the victory of one of teams.</p>
<p><em><strong>Oyabun / yakuza boss</strong></em> – the same role as <code>mafia boss</code> but for <code>yakuza</code>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sheriff</strong></em> – a civilian. Action at night – killing mafia members. If he “hits” civilians, his role doesn’t work.
<em>Available on all nights</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ripper</strong></em> – a conditionally civilian. The action at night is to destroy one player (unlike the <code>kamikaze</code>,
he himself doesn’t leave the game). He also has a spontaneous character, that is, it’s a source of randomness in the game.</p>
<p><em><strong>Judge</strong></em> – a civilian. The action at night is to protect one player from execution. The next voting
will take no effect on the protected player.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following are allowed in the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>at least one, but not more than 50% of players with the <code>mafia</code> role (including the <code>mafia boss</code>);</li>
<li>not more than 50% of players with <code>mafia</code> and <code>yakuza</code> roles (combined, including bosses) if <code>yakuza</code> is presented;</li>
<li>no more than one player in any role other than <code>townspeople</code>, <code>mafia</code> and <code>yakuza</code>;</li>
<li>unlimited number of <code>townspeople</code> (those left without a special role).</li>
</ul>
